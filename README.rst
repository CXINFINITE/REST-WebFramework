REST-WebFramework
*****************
.. Brief description of project, and its uses.
Web framework with REST methods, for educational purposes only.

What is it ?
============
REST-WebFramework is a web framework which uses REST's style to perform
all four HTTP CRUD (Create/Read/Update/Delete) operations like:
*  GET
*  POST
*  PUT
*  CREATE
*  DELETE
*  PATCH
*  etc...

Purpose
=======
Although there exists many frameworks for the same, this was built to
understand working of those systems on a lower level (not at low as packets)
and / or to practice coding.

Expectations
============
Although there were no future expectations when I (solo) started working on
this. But it might help someone looking for how to design similar systems
(to some extent) or help them solve some (if not none) coding problems.

I'm not planning to scale or convert this project to something big or so.
Though I'll try (at my level) to improve code quality, readibility and
simplify them.

BTW, you are free to fork and work on the project.
(I'm not looking forward to any PRs, atleast not now)
